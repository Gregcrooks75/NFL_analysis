This project explores the athletic traits that most influence whether a player will be drafted into the NFL, focusing on how these traits vary by position. By analyzing historical data on player performance in various drills, we aim to uncover the critical factors that distinguish drafted players from those who go undrafted.

The process involves:
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Handling missing values, correcting formatting issues, and standardizing the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating the distribution and relationships between various athletic metrics across different positions.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating composite scores for strength, agility, speed, and overall athleticism.
- **Modeling with XGBoost:** Using machine learning to determine the top athletic features that predict draft outcomes by position.

The findings offer insights into the specific athletic qualities that NFL scouts value when selecting players for the draft.
